Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose).\n\nThe symptoms can often develop slowly, sometimes over years, and may not be immediately obvious. In some cases, people with type 2 diabetes might not even notice symptoms at first.\n\nHere are some of the most common symptoms associated with type 2 diabetes:\n\n### Classic Symptoms (Related to High Blood Sugar)\n\n1.  **Increased Thirst (Polydipsia):** High glucose levels cause the kidneys to work harder to filter and absorb the excess sugar. This process pulls more fluid from your tissues, making you feel thirsty.\n2.  **Frequent Urination (Polyuria):** Because the kidneys are working overtime to flush out the sugar, you may need to ur urinate more often, especially at night.\n3.  **Increased Hunger (Polyphagia):** Even though you are eating, your body's cells aren't getting the glucose they need for energy, leading to constant feelings of hunger.\n\n### Other Common Symptoms\n\n*   **Fatigue:** Lack of glucose entering the cells for energy can cause you to feel constantly tired and sluggish.\n*   **Blurred Vision:** High blood sugar can cause fluid to shift into and out of the lenses of your eyes, making it difficult to focus.\n*   **Slow-Healing Sores or Frequent Infections:** High blood sugar can affect circulation and impair the body's natural healing process, leading to slow wound healing or an increased risk of infections (like skin or yeast infections).\n*   **Tingling or Numbness (Neuropathy):** Damage to the nerves, often in the hands and feet, can be an early sign or complication.\n*   **Unexplained Weight Loss:** While less common than in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 2 diabetes may lose weight without trying, as the body begins to burn fat and muscle for energy due to the inability to use glucose properly.\n\nIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms, or if you have concerns about your risk for diabetes, it is highly recommended that you speak with a healthcare provider for proper screening and evaluation.\n\n---\n*Disclaimer: I am an AI assistant and not a medical professional.
